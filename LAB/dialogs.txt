The, warrior doesn’t mourn the dead, until the war is over.
The blood of our enemies is your armor
Good can come out of even the darkest acts
Victory stands on the back of sacrifice
Being a good leader means knowing which battles to fight
Try not to die
Who we are and who we need to be to survive are two very different things
Hesitation, is death
There are no good guys
The world’s been trying to turn me into a monster for as long as I can remember
